## Reporting a Vulnerability

We have enabled GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature for this repository. This is the preferred method for reporting security issues.

1.  Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/BranchingBad/zone-poker/security) of the Zone-Poker repository.
2.  Click on "Report a vulnerability".
3.  Fill out the form with as much detail as possible, including a description of the vulnerability, its potential impact, and step-by-step instructions to reproduce it.

This method ensures that your report is delivered directly to the maintainers and remains private while we investigate.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

### Our Commitment
